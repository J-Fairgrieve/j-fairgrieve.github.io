            <p>A keen data analyst with 7 years' experience working with data in a variety of roles. Quick to grasp new concepts. With a BSc Mathematics and Statistics, my skills have recently developed further with a Data Analytics certification awarded by the University of Birmingham.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is an extension of my CV, built using HTML and Bootstrap in order to showcase some of the interesting topics I have covered in my free time. If you have any questions about me, my projects or anything else, please find my contact details in the links at the top of your browser window.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio!</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Shortly after graduating from University, I joined Staples (office supply company) as their Enterprise Bid & Pricing Analyst. In this role, I was responsible for creating pricing models for various bids that would come through the business. My speciality was with the larger bids that stretched across Europe, meaning that I would work closely with colleagues across the European offices. The size and scope of each bid meant that I would need to adapt the pricing accordingly and understand the needs for each project.</p>

            <p>After a year working at Staples, I joined Marston's (pub and beer company) as their HR Systems Advisor. This was my first role working with HR data. At Marston's I was responsible for producing regular reports to cover business needs. Some key metrics reported on included turnover, stability and sickness/absence. I was also responsible for collating, presenting and writing reports on the Gender Pay Gap. This was the first major project I was able to take ownership of from start to finish and I thoroughly enjoyed having the freedom to produce write-up reports explaining the changes each year.</p>

            <p>Currently I work as an HR Information Systems Analyst at Eversheds Sutherland (law firm).</p>
