            <p>This project makes use of two APIs:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap API</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a></li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-left">About the Project</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Please note, the data for this project was collected on 25/09/2022. There are three sections in total for this project:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Using the OpenWeatherMap API</b><br>
                    In this section, a list of city names are curated using a randomly generated set of 1,500 co-ordinates. These cities are subsequently used for the API calls, generating the weather information for analysis throughout the rest of the project.<br>
                    Overall, the API retreived the weather information for 560 cities.</li>
                    <li><b>Analysing the Extracted Data</b><br>
                    A quick analysis was taken using the weather features collated (Max Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and Cloudiness). Any outliers are identified and highlighted, but not removed in this case. The features were then compared against the Latitude of each city co-ordinate to identify any trend in the weather as you approach the equator.</li>
                    <li><b>Using Google Maps API</b><br>
                    Finally, the Google Maps API was used to plot the humidity changes across the globe. After defining the ideal weather conditions for a holiday, map markers were then generated to show the nearest hotel in relation to the city co-ordinates.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-left">Analysis</h2>

            <h5 class="text-left">Outliers</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>The easiest way to identify outliers visually is by creating box plots:<br>
            <img src="https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/Weather-API/blob/main/Images/Weather%20Feature%20Boxplot.png?raw=true"><br>
            The box plots instantly identify the outliers present in both the Humidity and Wind Speed features. From these graphs we can also see that CLoudiness has the highest variance and Wind Speed appears to be skewed across slower speeds.</p>

            <h5 class="text-left">Latitude vs. Temperature</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Note, visualisations were produced to compare each weather feature against latitude and can be viewed in the code file on GitHub. However, only the Max Temperature appeared to have a correlation so I have only included those charts here.<br>
            <img src="https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/Weather-API/raw/main/Images/Latitude%20vs%20Max%20Temp.png?raw=true"><br>
            A clear curve can be seen. The highest observed temperatures can be seen where the Latitude is close to the equator. The further north or south you travel, the lower the temperature will be.</p>

            <h5 class="text-left">Linear Regression</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Similarly to the previous section, linear regression models have been created for every weather feature but only the Max Temperature findings will be discussed. The other charts have very low R Squared values so do not explain a high proportion of the variance. However, all models can be viewed in the code file.<br>
            In order to perform the linear regression models, the data has been split into Northern/Southern hemisphere DataFrames. In the sample cities, there were 386 cities in the northern hemisphere and 174 cities in the southern hemisphere.<br>
            <img src="https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/Weather-API/raw/main/Images/Temperature%20Regression%20North.png?raw=true"><br>
            The northern hemisphere regression model has an R Squared value of 0.697, demonstrating a strong correlation between the Latitude and the Max Temperature. Looking at the graph, the variance appears to be greater as the latutude decreases.<br>
            <img src="https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/Weather-API/raw/main/Images/Temperature%20Regression%20South.png?raw=true"><br>
            At first sight, the southern hemisphere model definitely displays a higher variance than the northern model. This is demonstrated further with the lower R Squared value of 0.550. This could be due to the smaller sample size of southern cities in this dataset.</p>
